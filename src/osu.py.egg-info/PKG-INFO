        Easy to use API wrapper for osu!api written in Python. 
        This uses osu!api v2, which is still under development. 
        So some code that was originally working may break overnight. 
        However, I'll do my best to fix any issues I find as quick as possible. 
        You can report issues [here](https://github.com/Sheepposu/osu.py/issues) 
        or make a [pull request](https://github.com/Sheepposu/osu.py/pulls) 
        if you'd like to contribute.
        
        # Installation
        *Installing the current version out on pypi:*
        
        Linux/macOS
        ```commandline
        python3 -m pip install -U osu.py
        ```
        Windows
        ```commandline
        py -3 -m pip install -U osu.py
        ```
        
        *Installing the development version straight from the github (make sure to replace 'version' with the version number shown on the whl file.):*
        ```commandline
        git clone https://github.com/Sheepposu/osu.py
        cd osu.py/dist
        python3 -m pip install -U osu.py-version-py3-none-any.whl
        ```
        
        # Example
        ```Python
        from osu import Client, AuthHandler
        
        
        client_id = 0
        client_secret = "***"
        redirect_uri = "http://127.0.0.1:8080"
        
        auth = AuthHandler(client_id, client_secret, redirect_uri)
        auth.get_auth_token()
        
        client = Client(auth)
        
        user_id = 14895608
        mode = 'osu'
        user = client.get_user(user_id, mode)
        print(user.username)
        ```
